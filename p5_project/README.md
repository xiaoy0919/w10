## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

For my project, I was inspired by the splendid images of falling meteors. That is , the aesthetic of bright, colorful meteors falling from the sky gives a dreamlike, surreal feeling to all the scenes. Thus, I believe this technique will enhance my final project by creating a fantastical and visually appealing atmosphere. Moreover, the elegance of the meteors and their dynamic movements make them a great fit for my design. Namely,these falling stars can give a fantasy-like vibe for my project, adding depth and wonder to the visuals.

##  Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To implement the falling meteor effect, I adapted a p5.js code example that creates floating objects with trails from happycodding.io. Moreover, this code can be easily modified to resemble falling meteors by adjusting the trail size and color. Also,the p5.js code allows for dynamic animation of multiple objects (meteors) on screen. That is, each object moving with individual randomness. By using  technique, I can create a magical and interactive scene where numerous meteors fall, adding visual depth and enhancing mysterious vibe in the project.
