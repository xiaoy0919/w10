## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

For my project, I was inspired by the splendid images of falling meteors. That is , the aesthetic of bright, colorful meteors falling from the sky gives a dreamlike, surreal feeling to all the scenes. Thus, I believe this technique will enhance my final project by creating a fantastical and visually appealing atmosphere. Moreover, the elegance of the meteors and their dynamic movements make them a perfect backgroud for my design. Namely,these falling stars can give a fantasy-like vibe for my project, adding depth and wonder to the visuals.

##  Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To bring the meteor effect to life, I adapted a p5.js code example from happycoding.io that originally simulates floating objects with trailing effects. That is,I changed the floating objects into falling meteors by editing things like the tailLength, speed, and color of each object. Also, I adjusted the randomness in the movement and increased the transparency at the tail's end to replicate the glowing and fading effect of meteors. The use of object-oriented programming in p5.js allows each meteor to move independently Thus, it creates a dynamic and interactive experience where multiple meteors fall simultaneously. In sum, this technique not only makes the scene pretty but also provides flexibility in customizing the behavior of each meteor, making the overall vibe more alive.
